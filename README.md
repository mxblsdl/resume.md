# resume.md

Resume builder for python. Forked and modified as needed. I had previously made my resume using an R Markdown package, [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown), but found the stylized format is hard for machines to parse. I wanted a more generic look to my resume and have switched to this implementation.
